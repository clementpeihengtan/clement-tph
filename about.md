# Hello
I am Clement, a rising junior who is currently studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

I am from Malaysia, a place located at Southeast Asia, bordered by Thailand, Indonesia, and Brunei and shares water boundaries with Singapore, Vietnam, and Philippines.

I speak 3 different languages, which are English, Mandarin and Bahasa Malaysia.

I am interested in software development. This interests of mine lead me to the path of Computer Engineering. This path allows me to develop teamwork and help others to solve problems as there are a lots of challenging groups projects.  

When I am not a programmer, I try to be a good photo editor.
