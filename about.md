# Hello
I am Clement, a senior year student who is currently studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

I am from Malaysia, a place located at Southeast Asia, bordered by Thailand, Indonesia, and Brunei and shares water boundaries with Singapore, Vietnam, and Philippines.

I speak 3 different languages, which are English, Mandarin and Bahasa Malaysia.

I am interested in software development. This interests of mine lead me to the path of Computer Science. Learning the language of computer enable us to further enhance the power of computing and increase the efficiency of modern computer. 

Teamwork is important in software development as we can share our different idea with each other and learn things from others.

When I am not a programmer, I try to be a good photo editor.
