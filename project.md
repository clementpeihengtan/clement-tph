# Tautology Checker

During Fall 2016, I have taken a course which require us to write code in **[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)**. Through out the course, I got the chance to do some interesting projects, one of them is the **[Tautology checker](https://github.com/clementpeihengtan/Tautology-Checker)**. What it basically does is to check whether a propositional logic is a tautology.

# Personal Bio-website

**[This website](http://clementpeihengtan.github.io)** is designed based on a template called **[Spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral)**. By using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I was able to manipulate the layout of the template and added some interesting features in it.
