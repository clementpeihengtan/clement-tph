WYSIWYG is an abbreviation to “what you see is what you get”. It is pronounced as wiz-ee-wig. WYSIWYG editor is a program that allow developer to see the end result on a user interface that is being created.

This allows web developer to see the result they typed instantly without the need of using any descriptive code.(markup).

I personally think that it is good for expert but not for beginner as they need to grasp the strong basic of coding using markup language. With this type of editor, it definitely ease web developer in managing the way the interface or document is presented to the audience.

However, beginner should explore and challenge the beauty of HTML, by hard coding it using normal editor. As they progress, they will have a stronger understanding regarding HTML.

Instead of using this editor, it is a good practice to use HTML as WYSIWYG editor sometimes will inserts some markup that it thinks that it needed. Developer has to know the logic behind this Markup language.
