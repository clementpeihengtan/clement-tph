If you guys have visited my [previous website](https://clementpeihengtan.github.io), you can see a huge difference between the website I am currently working on. There are three main reason, why I choose to create a new website.

## Simplicity

First of all, I want to keep things simple, Jekyll helps me to organize my stuff, which allow me to arrange my website easily. Compare to my previous website, which is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without Jekyll, liquid or any markdown language. Things get a little messy when you have to handle a bunch of pages and post in the website. 

> Simplicity is not the absence of clutter, that's a consequence of simplicity. Simplicity is somehow essentially describing the purpose and place of an object and product. The absence of clutter is just a clutter-free product. That's not simple. ~ Jonathan Ive

Jekyll allows me to simplified my project without losing the important aspect in web development. With clear and organized structure, I am able to maintain it over the long run.

## Clarity

The idea of making things clear led me to create a whole new website. The theme I previously used for my website, is quite ‘fancy’ in a sense that it looks complicated, the information is not welly presented. With this new website, I keep my things clear. Instead of putting different paragraph on different site of the page, I chose to put all my content in the center of the page. This creates consistency throughout of my web pages. 

## Efficiency

Jekyll allows me to modify and add content easily. I do not need to waste time creating a whole new page. Instead, I can just add a markdown file and Jekyll will do the rest of the job for me. This safes times and reduce my workload as well. 

However, all this advantage achieved from my hard work. Learning new things make things easier.
